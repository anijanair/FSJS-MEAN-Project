# FSJS-MEAN-Project

 My Code Louisville FSJS Project. A web app designed to let users create their own To-Do lists, add items to the lists, edit the tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them.                                                                                                    
   It is a MEAN stack app, requiring MongoDB installed to run it. I have installed webpack as module bundler, also installed mongoose and body-parser.
